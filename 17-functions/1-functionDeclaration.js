// Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.

// To create a function we can use a function declaration.
// Syntax:
// function name() {
//     body of the function
// }

// 1.

// ---------##---------
// 2.
// The function has full access to the outer variable. It can modify it as well.

// ---------##---------
// Global Scope
// The outer variable is only used if there's no local scope.
// If a same-named variable is declared inside the function, then it shows the outer one.
// Global variables are visible from any function.

// 3.
// A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that function.

// ---------##---------
// A word on naming functions:
// Functions are actions. So their name is usually a verb. It should be brief, as accurate as possible and describe what the function does, so that someone reading the code gets an indication of what the function does.

// It is a widespread practice to start a function with a verbal prefix which vaguely describes the action. There must be an agreement within the team on the meaning of the prefixes.

// For instance, functions that start with "show" usually show something.

// Function starting with…

// "get…" – return a value,
// "calc…" – calculate something,
// "create…" – create something,
// "check…" – check something and return a boolean, etc.
