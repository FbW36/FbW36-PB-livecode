// Arrow Functions are very convenient for simple one-line actions, when we’re just too lazy to write many words.

// The examples below take arguments from the left of => and evaluated the right-side expression with them.

/*
Arrow functions are handy for one-liners. They come in two flavors:
Without curly braces: (...args) => expression – the right side is an expression: the function evaluates it and returns the result.
With curly braces: (...args) => { body } – brackets allow us to write multiple statements inside the function, but we need an explicit return to return something.
