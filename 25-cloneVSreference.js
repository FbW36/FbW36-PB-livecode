/**
 Primitives
- If a primitive type is assigned to a variable, we can think of that variable as containing the primitive value.

- When we assign these variables to other variables using =, we copy the value to the new variable. They are copied by value.

- Changing one does not change the other. Think of the variables as having no relationship to each other.

/**
  Reference data type Objects And Arrays

  -Variables that are assigned a non-primitive value are given a reference to that 
  value. That reference points to the object’s location in memory. The variables don’t actually contain the value.
